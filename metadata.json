    "Title": "Multi-target prediction based on ChEMBL data",
    "Description": "This is a ligand-based target prediction model developed by the ChEMBL team. They trained the model using pairs of small molecules and their protein targets, and produced a predictor for two cut-offs: 1uM and 10uM. The model predicts the main target of a small molecule with an accuracy of 69%. These predictors are available since ChEMBL\\_18 and have been subsequently updated since. You can read more about it in the ChEMBL blogpost. Here we use the ChEMBL\\_25 version (2019).\n",
